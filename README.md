## Jets Project

### Week 2 Homework for Skill Distillery

*This project creates a fictional air wing, where the user can add planes to the hanger to its capacity of 10. Originally all pilot names were set to strings before refactoring Pilot to its own class and assigning them to an object. In creating this project I had difficulty differentiating between "has a" and "is a" while working with new classes, objects and variables. The user can add up to 5 additional aircraft, at which point the program notifies the user that they have reached the hangers capacity. The program will then print out the additional aircraft after re-running the #1 request. It also includes the new aircraft in the fastest and longest range comparisons. I am exploring ways to remove specific jets from the array.
